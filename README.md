# Create-UniquesArtworksFilter
Uses poe.ninja and poedb.tw to pull artwork based on chaos price to create a UniquesArtworksFilter.txt

$DefaultChaosValue = 2 and $DefaultLeagueName = "Archnemesis". Can be easily changed to fit your needs.

You may need to run "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" first to run PowerShell scripts on your machine.
